The folder includes 5 subfolders, 
1. 'common codes' : These codes can be used to generate the plots (Fig. 2-5) in the main text. 

2. 'chemistry' : This folder includes 4 .ipynb files to process the data for the main plots. And 3 subfolders.
  (1)'chemistry fig2 preparation.ipynb' : to export the number of mentees, surviral rate of mentees, fecundity of mentees, yearly citations of mentees

  (2)'merge publishing info.ipynb' : process the publications data of analyzed targets in this paper

  (3)'for chemistry collaboration.ipynb' : export the mentor-mentee collaboration relationships

  (4)'export chemistry regression data.ipynb' : export data for corasen exact matching(CEM) regression models

  (5)'data' : This folder links to the data curated in the same folder at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/h2rgjzrggp/draft?a=f9fda85e-78fb-4e86-a253-5e8308f4b530 .
  (6)'publications preprocess' : This folder includes the codes to process the match Microsoft Academic Graph(MAG) and Academic Family Tree(AFT).

  (7)'Regression R' : This folder includes the data and R codes for three regression models.
  
3. 'physics' : This folder includes the same contents as the 'chemistry' folder in physics.

4. 'neuro' : This folder includes the same contents as the 'chemistry' folder in neuro.

5. 'SI' : This folder contains 3 subfolders:
  (1)'code' : This folder includes 6 .ipynb files to generate the plots in SI. The files' name are corresponding to the plots' name in SI.
  (2)'data' : This folder links to the data curated n the same folder at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/h2rgjzrggp/draft?a=f9fda85e-78fb-4e86-a253-5e8308f4b530 .
  (3)'Regression Results Test' : This folder includes the data and R codes for the significance test of three regression models.

To reader who want to replicate the results of this paper:
1. The folder is the same as the folder at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/h2rgjzrggp/draft?a=f9fda85e-78fb-4e86-a253-5e8308f4b530 . But the second folder includes the data you need for the codes.

2. The file address in the codes is wrote by the author's PC local address. Thus, after downloading the data and codes, you have to change the file address in codes to run it rightly. 

3. If you have any questions about the data and codes, please email to yanmengxing@mail.bnu.edu.cn .
